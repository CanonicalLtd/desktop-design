We will proceed by mocking up individual components, keeping in mind that our current long-term plan is to integrate them all into a Dash containing:
 * search with categorized results
 * application launcher
 * free space for notifications
 * Places and Trash
 * widgets
 * application and/or window switcher.

Separately, the application launcher alone should appear to display application launch feedback.

== Quick Launcher ==

=== Behavior on login ===

We need mockups of the launcher appearing:
 * automatically at login
 * manually when an Ubuntu button is clicked appearing a subtly-animated Ubuntu button to bring up the launcher.

=== Presentation of applications ===

 * Which applications should be shown by default?
  * Firefox
  * Evolution
  * Pidgin/Empathy
  * F-Spot
  * Rhythmbox/Banshee
  * OpenOffice.org

 * Size of icons
 * Size of text

 * When should application names be shown?
  * Show mockups of always vs. hover-only
  * Beware that hover-only is touch-incompatible
  * Ellipsize over-long names?

 * Descriptions accessible at all? No, they suck

 * How do we show launching apps?
  * Immediate feedback
  * Cursor changes
  * Icon zooms toward you (whether it's an application or a document)
  * Don't showing the Quick Launcher if it wasn't open already

 * How do we distinguish running from non-running apps? Possibilities:
  * We might decide to fade out non-running apps in app switcher
  * icon itself could change
  * glow around the icon
  * launcher itself

=== Presentation of search results ===

 * show the full name

=== Application browser ===

Search works only if you know and remember that an application already exists on the computer. We also need a browser to show a categorized list of whatâ€™s possible. This also gives you something quick to access applications for dragging them to the quick launcher.

=== Adding and removing shortcuts ===

 * Some sort of subtle Customize button that takes you to an editing mode. In the editing mode:
  * each application has a button for removing it?
  * text saying "Drag applications to or from the launcher"
  * like a drag-and-drop Customize Toolbar dialog, but searchable
  * also offer applications you haven't even installed yet
   * the first time you try it, ask for authorization
  * everything looks fabulous
  * you can drag stuff within the launcher to rearrange it
  * you can drag stuff into the launcher from anywhere, not just the 
 * Also a shortcut menu for each application, containing Launch, Keep in Launcher/Remove from Launcher, Quit.

== App and/or window switcher ==

Alt Tab

 * mockup of window-based switcher
 * mockup of application-based switcher

== Search ==

=== What are the categories and order of results? ===

 * What should be included?
  * Web search, either results or links
  * local files
  * bookmarks
  * history
  * recent documents
  * address book
  * calendar events
 * plug-in mechanism so unusual applications can provide searchable data
 * ordering results
  * -maybe- based on what applications you have open at the time
   * e.g. prioritize photos if you have F-Spot open
  * -maybe- change the order based on learned behavior

=== Can you limit the search scope? ===

 * e.g. show just photos
 * maybe not, maybe just scroll to them
 * we should user-test this

=== How are results presented? ===

 * Location
  * Results replace the quick launcher, places etc?
   * Doesn't work so well if you want to drag a result to the launcher.
    * If you start dragging, the other results fade out and the launcher+places reappear.
    * When you drop, maybe the launcher+places fade back out and the results fade back in.
   * Maybe an explicit button somewhere for clearing a search.
 * Layout
  * in rows
  * each result has an icon plus text by default
  * maybe a slider for changing the size of results
 * Issue: if there are many results in an early category, the later categories may be invisible.
  * Have a thumbnail navigator showing your currently-visible section?
 * Grouping and sorting
  * by time (e.g. touching a time slider, or selecting from a calendar)
  * by kind (e.g. photos vs. system settings categories)
  * by tag (for photos)
 * Expanding/contracting the search
  * by starting letter (e.g. iPhone's Contacts index)

 * "I want a photo that I took the same day that I had that meeting about X"
 * How will people tell what touching particular parts will do?
 * How can you keep search results around for multiple accesses?
 * How can you drag a result to a particular window?
  * Drag to the application icon, wait, then drag to the window thumbnail, wait, then drag to the appropriate place in the window.

=== How is lack of results presented? ===

 * Search Google should always be there

=== What can you do with results? ===

 * Launching multiple results

=== How many results? How to present overflow? ===

=== Should we encourage moving common results to the Launcher? ===

=== Should you be able to leave results open while doing something else? ===

== Places and Trash ==

== Widgets ==

== Power ==

 * Power button in the Dash brings up a power layer
 * Wi-fi item in the Dash brings up a list of wireless networks in its own Dash layer

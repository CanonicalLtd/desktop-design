I suggest restructuring the document with sections answering each of these questions:

Why would someone use a tile or gadget?
- Give half a dozen tangible examples.
  - Some should have multiple views, some should have single views.

Where will I find tiles and gadgets?
- How will I install the tile/gadget for the Web site I'm visiting?
- How will I make a tile/gadget for a Web site that doesn't have a custom one?

How do I place a tile or gadget?
- How will it be placed on first installation?
- How do I move it later on?
- Can I have a tile or gadget outside the Dash? Why or why not?
  - If so, how do I move it to and from the Dash?



How do I tell whether a {tile, gadget, desktop} I'm looking at has a {gadget, desktop, tile} version?

How do I switch from {tile, gadget, desktop} view to {gadget, desktop, tile} view?
